Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and Malaysian Research and Education Network (MYREN)
organized and conducted the SecureAsi@ v2.0 Advanced Security training workshop for
year 2018 in Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia from 10th December till 14th
December 2018.

The proposed workshop was aimed at bringing Asi@Connect partners’ network engineers
and security administrators to the level qualified for the operation & management of
network for their NRENs and therefore promote international collaborations as well as
Asi@Connect applications.

As more and more security breaches being reported throughout the globe, it is such
necessary that NRENs are more equipped to proactively identify potential security issues in
their network BEFORE they are being exploited by hackers and malware. For that reason,
this workshop provided a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge/experience
to the participants of the workshop in terms of a more secure NREN.
USM provided two of its security experts and engaged with Technical University of
Darmstadt (TUD) Germany to invite another expert in the field of Cyber Security to
conduct the workshop over a period of five (5) days. The plan for the workshop was jointly
developed by USM and TUD.

The objectives of the conducted workshop were:
- To provide an overview of Cybersecurity.
- To familiarize with concepts of malware, botnet, social engineering and other
threats.
- To learn the latest Internet security techniques, firewalls etc.
- To provide a basic knowledge of ethical hacking using Kali Linux.

Instructors:
- Dr. Shankar Karuppayah
- Assoc. Prof. Dr. Selvakumar Manickam
- Leon Böck
